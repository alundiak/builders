# JavaScript Build Tools Collection

This repo is an educational container for known Code Builders aka Compilers if the targeted language is JavaScript. I collect and experiment basic setups here, so that at any time I could look up and remind myself when needed.

Collection of well known build (bundling) tools examples:

* [Grunt.JS](http://gruntjs.com/) - old
* [Gulp.JS](http://gulpjs.com/) - kinda old
* [Crom](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11343557) - outdated/obsolete?
* [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org)
* [Parcel](https://parceljs.org)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - so far seems to be the best in trend.
* [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) #TODO
* [Brocolli](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli) #TODO
* [Brunch](http://brunch.io/) #TODO
* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) #TODO
* [Bun](https://bun.sh/) #TODO
* [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) #TODO
* [SWC](https://swc.rs/) #TODO


## Shields and badges

Depends on build tool or environment using https://shields.io/badges HTML/Markdown code can be generated there.


## Node.JS
If u don't have **Node.JS** install it from [official website](http://nodejs.org).

Note: `init.sh` install many tools, but step-by-step is below.

## Global Ruby dependencies (optional for Grunt and Gulp setup)
If code relies on `grunt sass`, `grunt compass`, `grunt scsslint` tasks, those are based on Ruby parsing.
If u r not on Mac OS, Install Ruby from [official website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).
If u r on Mac OS u may need just to upgrade Ruby and ruby-gems.
In both cases, u have then to install:

```
gem install sass compass
```

But. May-2021:

```
Ruby Sass has reached end-of-life and should no longer be used.

* If you use Sass as a command-line tool, we recommend using Dart Sass, the new
  primary implementation: https://sass-lang.com/install

* If you use Sass as a plug-in for a Ruby web framework, we recommend using the
  sassc gem: https://github.com/sass/sassc-ruby#readme

* For more details, please refer to the Sass blog:
  https://sass-lang.com/blog/posts/7828841

```

Note: Bootstrap v5 has already migrated to Dart Sass. So it seems to be a trend.
So maybe it's time for me to upgrade to https://github.com/sass/dart-sass


```
#sudo gem install scss-lint
sudo gem install scss_lint
```

> WARNING: `scss-lint` has been renamed to `scss_lint` to follow proper RubyGems naming conventions. Update your Gemfile or relevant install scripts to install `scss_lint`.


So final output:

```

```


## Grunt setup

```
npm run grunt
```
Notes:
- For more npm/grunt commands, look to `Gruntfile.js`.
- Due to the fact, that Grunt was popular in 2016-2017 year, and 2020-2021 it becomes rather not famous, many contrib packages are either outdated or at least upgraded to Grunt v1.x. So need for full installation need to use `--force` or `--legacy-peer-deps`. `npm audit` shows many warnings, but I am not sure it make sense to upgrade.
- Not sure if `node-sass` v4.x installation has been failing in May-2021, but v6.x seems to be OK.
- Not sure why but `node-sass-middleware` v0.11.0 is failing (node -v v16.1.0, node-gyp -v v3.8.0).
- https://timonweb.com/javascript/how-to-fix-referenceerror-primordials-is-not-defined-error/
    >gulp v3 doesn't work (as of now) under node v12, because it depends on graceful-fs@^3.0.0 which patches Node's fs module and that patch worked before node v12 just fine.

**Git Hooks related to Grunt setup**:

Inside of folder `/Users/{user}/prj/builders/.git/hooks` added code for th `pre-commit` hook. It blocks `git commit`.


## Gulp setup

```
npm run gulp
```



## Crom setup

"Crom â€“ A package manager without the package registry" - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11343557
I remember initially, that was somehow popular. Created by same author of D3.js - https://github.com/mbostock/crom
But now this repo is NOT available.
Other repos: https://github.com/mbostock/crom-test-bar, https://github.com/mbostock/crom-test-foo

```
npm run crom
```

## Broccoli setup

```
npm run broccoli
```

## Rollup setup

```
npm run rollup
```

FYI:
- https://github.com/rollup/rollup-starter-project


## Parcel setup

```
npm run parcel
```

And navigate to http://localhost:1234/

FYI:
- https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html



## Webpack setup

- https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/
- https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#root
- https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server

```
npm run webpack
```
