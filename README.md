> Collection of "grunt contrib packages/modules usage examples" to work with on any project or get started during study. 

##Install
### Node.JS
If u don't have **Node.JS** install it from [official website](http://nodejs.org).

### Grunt CLI and Bower
If u don't have **Grunt CLI** and **Bower** node.js packages globally, do it - install them all :)
```
npm install grunt-cli gulp bower -g
```

### Ruby's sass and compass gems (optional)
- Needed for 'grunt sass' and 'grunt compass' tasks based on Ruby parsing)
If u r not on Mac OS, Install Ruby from [official website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).
If u r on Mac OS u may need just to upgrade Ruby and ruby-gems.
In both cases, u have then to install 2 gems:
```
gem install sass compass scss-lint
```
### Project setup
Clone this source code, and then inside of it hit these 2 commands:
```
npm install && bower install
```
And u ready to go. To get started hit the command
```
grunt DoAll
```
Expected to see many jslint issues :) But it's expected, so it's fine.
